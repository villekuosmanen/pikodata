# Pikodata
Data Studio for LeRobot Datasets

[Join the Discord!](https://discord.gg/VDqCJhZb)

Private Beta - expect bugs!

Known issues:
1. Not optimised for first render - if it needs to download datasets locally (datasets stored in default LeRobot directory, `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot` on Linux the app looks like it has frozen even though it is waiting for data to load. I recommend downloading the datasets you use to the cache first, or using very fast internet.
2. Sometimes the web server ends in zombie state, you can kill it manually on port 8000
3. Doesn't run on MacBook Air for some reason.
